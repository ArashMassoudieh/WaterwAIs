# WaterWays project folder structure
#

The WaterWays project folder structure matches the project software architecture.

Each folder is dediccated to contain code for some project component or a logical
group of components.

The current structure is defined as follows:

[Root folder]
	Contains only the entry point source file (main.cpp).
	The other code files (header and source) should be placed into corresponding
	folders (see below).
	
	The goal is to keep the root folder as lean as possible, so it stores only a
	minimal set of code and project build files.
	
[Application]
	Contains application business logic files not related to the UI/presentation.
	  (main application class, settings etc).
	  
	Put general non-UI application-specific code there.
	
[Common]
	Contains some general purpose code files there (i.e. downloader etc.)
    
	[Layer]
		This subfolder contains base general code serving as a boilerplate
		for implementing map views "layers".
		
		The code there provides protototypes for classes implementing layer model,
		layer model items and layer graphical items.
		
[FeatureLayer]		
	Contains layer implementation for the "feature" layer 
	(like SubWaterSheds, PourPoints etc).
	
[MetaModelLayer]	
	Contains layer implementation for the "meta model" layer (nodes, links)
	
[UI]
	Contains UI/presentation code - views, dialogs etc.
	All presentation code should be placed there.
	
[Utilities]
	Contains a subset of Arash's math utilities used by the project.
	
[Resources]
	Contains project resources - image files, icons etc.
	
[Forms]
	Contains Qt UI form files (*.ui)
	All Qt UI form files should be placed there.
